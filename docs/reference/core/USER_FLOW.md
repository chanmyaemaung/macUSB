# User Flow and Navigation

## Main Flow Contract

The primary flow remains:
- `WelcomeView -> SystemAnalysisView -> UniversalInstallationView -> CreationProgressView -> FinishUSBView`

Destructive start requires explicit confirmation.

## Current Runtime Behavior

- User selects source and runs analysis.
- Analysis resolves compatibility flags and workflow branch.
- User selects target USB and confirms destructive start.
- Progress screen reflects helper-driven stages.
- Finish screen reports success/failure/cancel plus cleanup status.

Linux-specific runtime behavior:
- recognized Linux image (`.iso`) unlocks the same shared install flow,
- USB validation keeps capacity gating, while APFS blocking is macOS-only (Linux uses physical `diskX` targets),
- creation branch uses Linux raw-copy helper stages.

## Tools Flow: Downloader

- `Tools -> Download macOS installer...` opens downloader window.
- `SystemAnalysisView` also exposes `Pobierz` between `Wybierz` and `Analizuj` for direct downloader access.
- Downloader opening is blocked during USB creation operation stages (`UniversalInstallationView`, `CreationProgressView`, `FinishUSBView`), and `Tools -> Pobierz instalator macOS...` is disabled there.
- Discovery starts on entering downloader window (never on app startup).
- While discovery runs, header/options remain visible; list area shows scanning panel.
- After discovery completes, grouped systems list is shown.
- On downloader summary, when final `.app` exists, icon action can pass installer path to analysis and trigger automatic analysis; from Welcome, app navigates to analysis first.

## Update Trigger

Update when flow order, transitions, or gate behavior changes.

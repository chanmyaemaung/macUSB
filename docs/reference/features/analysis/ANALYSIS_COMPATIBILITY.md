# Analysis and Compatibility Contract

Current implementation scope includes:

- macOS analysis path (primary, workflow-driving),
- Linux image recognition fallback path with USB-creation handoff.

Linux-specific behavior details are documented in:

- `docs/reference/features/analysis/LINUX_ANALYSIS_FLOW.md`

## Detection Source of Truth

Analysis flags are the source of truth for workflow branch selection.
Unsupported detection outcomes must be clearly surfaced and must block unsupported paths.

For Linux fallback:

- detection is considered successful when Linux is recognized, including unknown distro case,
- recognized Linux result unlocks shared install flow (`UniversalInstallationView -> CreationProgressView -> FinishUSBView`),
- detected Linux state may present dedicated Linux icon resource (`linux.icns`) in analysis UI.
- manual Linux force from `Opcje -> Pomiń analizowanie pliku -> Linux` is treated as Linux-recognized state for install handoff.

## Current Supported Routing Families

- modern
- legacy
- restore-legacy
- PPC
- Sierra-specific
- Catalina-specific
- Mavericks-specific
- Linux raw-copy

Panther remains explicitly unsupported.

Linux fallback routing includes:

- recognized Linux distro,
- Linux with unknown distro (`Linux - nierozpoznana dystrybucja`).
- manually forced Linux (`Linux`).

## Special Blocking Rule

For `.cdr` and `.iso` sources:
- if the image is already manually mounted in macOS,
- analysis must stop and instruct user to unmount and retry.

This rule applies to both macOS and Linux fallback paths.

## Global Image Analysis Timeout

For `.dmg`, `.iso`, and `.cdr` sources:

- the full image-analysis session is guarded by a global 20-second timeout,
- if recognition does not complete within 20 seconds, analysis is force-finished as unrecognized (`Nie rozpoznano instalatora`),
- when timeout is hit, app must force-detach the mounted source image used for analysis (if present),
- timeout finish keeps existing UI behavior (no new messages/views), and blocks supported-flow routing as for other unrecognized outcomes,
- delayed callbacks from expired analysis sessions must be ignored and must not overwrite state after timeout.

## USB Unreadable Target Hint (Non-blocking)

During analysis screen USB target area:
- if a physical external USB disk is connected but unreadable for macOS mount stack, show a warning hint with Disk Utility guidance,
- this hint does not replace supported-target validation (capacity/APFS) for readable drives,
- generic `Nie wykryto nośnika USB` message is suppressed when unreadable USB hint is active and picker has no readable targets,
- Disk Utility action inside this hint remains interactive regardless of analysis-state gating for USB selection controls.

## Logging and Diagnostics

Analysis should log:
- selected source type,
- detected compatibility family/flags,
- explicit block reasons (for example mounted image conflict),
- image-analysis timeout start/finish events for `.dmg`/`.iso`/`.cdr`,
- timeout-triggered image detach result (success/failure + mount path),
- ignored stale callbacks when an expired image-analysis session returns results after timeout.

Linux fallback should additionally log:

- fallback transition from macOS detection to Linux detection,
- fallback transition from mounted detection to `bsdtar` detection when needed,
- parsed Linux details (`distro`, `version`, `edition`, `arch`, `isARM`),
- evidence summary used for recognition,
- archive-reader diagnostics relevant to bounded execution (`bsdtar` timeout/errors),
- install handoff readiness (`linuxSourceURL` present, capacity computed).
- manual-force diagnostics when Linux is forced from menu.

## Update Trigger

Update when detection heuristics, compatibility mapping, or blocking/handoff logic changes.
